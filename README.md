Ans 1: Yes
Ans 2: 24K ( this is the character size or bit size and as 1byte=8 bit so the byte size will be 3K as taught in the lecture slides)
Ans 3: So the format is stored in a way that each character will have unique value.Like a-0
C- 1 0 0
B-1 0 1
Like in a node left side will be represented by 0 and the right will be represented by 1. So after each branch, it will have a particular value.
